I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.
[S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

Prior to that, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BSE and MSE in Computer Science, where I was also fortunate to have worked with Prof. 
[Boon Thau Loo](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~boonloo/), and advised by Prof. 
[Max Mintz](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mintz/home.html).

My research is in the areas of algorithms, algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, and their applications to social good, inequality, and distributive justice.
