I am a Computer Science PhD student in the 
[Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.
[S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

Prior to that, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BSE and MSE in Computer Science, where I was also fortunate to have worked with Prof. 
[Boon Thau Loo](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~boonloo/), and advised by Prof. 
[Max Mintz](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mintz/home.html).

My current research interests are in Algorithmic Game Theory, with a focus on [Mechanism Design for Social Good](http://md4sg.com/). I am also interested in Algorithm Design and Theoretical Computer Science in general.
