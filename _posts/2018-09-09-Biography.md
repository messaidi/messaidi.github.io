I am a Computer Science PhD student in the 
[Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by 
[S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). 

Prior to that, I graduated from Univeristy of Pennsylvania with a BSE and MSE in Computer Science, where I was also fortunate to have worked with Prof. 
[Boon Thau Loo](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~boonloo/), and advised by Prof. 
[Max Mintz](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mintz/home.html).

My current research interests include Algorithmic Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Game Theory. I am also interested in Complexity Theory, Algorithm Design, and Theoretical Computer Science in general.
