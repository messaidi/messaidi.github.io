I am a Computer Science PhD student in the 
[Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by S. Matthew Weinberg. 

Prior to that, I worked as a Research Assistant with 
[Professor Boon Thau Loo](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~boonloo/) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I also did my BSE and MSE studies in Computer Science. 

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, with an emphasis on algorithmic mechanism design. My current research interests include Mechanism Design, Algorithms, and Game Theory.
